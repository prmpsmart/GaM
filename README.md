# its gui core is a widgets library and framework based on tkinter written by PRMPSmart prmpsmart@gmail.com  **prmp_gui**

#### The features of the underlying gui library are as follows:
1. Themed widgets, auto-updating the child widgets of a widget if its theme changes.
2. Highly extensible through subclassing.
3. The dialogs:
    * Calendar Dialog.
    * Message Dialog.
    <!-- * -->



- [x] The theme engine works better.
- [x] The calender dialog is better with good themes.
    some of the calendar's images are
   ![Alt text](/cal.PNG?raw=true "Theme 1")
   ![Alt text](/cal2.PNG?raw=true "Theme 2")
- [ ] The TreeView is still under construction.
