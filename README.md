# its gui core is a widgets library and framework based on tkinter written by @PRMPSmart prmpsmart@gmail.com  **prmp_gui**

#### The features of the underlying gui library are as follows:
1. Themed widgets, auto-updating the child widgets of a widget if its theme changes.
2. Highly extensible through subclassing and options.
3. The dialogs:
    * Calendar Dialog.
    * Message Dialog.
    * Message Box.
4. The font mechanism is awesome.
5. Widgets can be position at the same time when creating it.
    * No two lines again
    * One for creating it.
    * The second on for positioning the widget
    * The positioning mechanism [place, pack, grid] can be passed as place={}, pack={}, grid={} to the constructor of the widgets.
